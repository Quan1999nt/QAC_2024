    "In my python program, I did use the randint() method to generate random numbers. Basically, the randint() method in Python an integer number selected element from the specified range [1]. When we call method multiple times, the method would gives us different random integers. Therefore, we can infer that the values are random for each call and do not overlap in our case. Furthermore, when the number of calls is large and the range is quite smaller, in that case, the random values generated may collide or overlap [2]. Bellowing is function to generate random list and the result of the function which prove above point."

The complexity of this operation is O(2n).\n",

Ignoring the sorting step, binary search has a time complexity of O(log(n)), which is significantly better than looping through the entire list. For Task 1.2, with the index of 'k' found in the sorted list, we can create a sublist from the start to index 'k' using Python's list slicing. It's important to note that these time complexities represent average cases and may vary based on factors such as the list size and the specific operation being performed [4]"
