When we call method multiple times, the method would gives us different random integers. Therefore, we can infer that the values are random for each call and do not overlap in our case. Furthermore, when the number of calls is large and the range is quite smaller, in that case, the random values generated may collide or overlap [2].

    "The review article by Ma et al. discusses the generation of true random numbers using quantum physics, which is essential for applications like cryptography. Classical random number generators (RNGs) typically rely on deterministic processes to generate sequences of numbers that appear random. These processes are often based on algorithms that expand a random seed, which is a short sequence of truly random bits. The outputs of classical RNGs, also known as pseudo-random number generators, can be reproduced if the initial seed and the algorithm are known. While these numbers are sufficient for many applications, such as simulations and non-cryptographic randomness, they are not truly random because they are deterministic and can exhibit patterns or correlations over long sequences. Quantum random number generators (QRNGs), on the other hand, harness the inherent randomness of quantum mechanical processes to generate truly random numbers. These processes, such as the measurement of a quantum state or the detection of single photons, are fundamentally probabilistic and cannot be predicted with certainty, even in principle. This means that QRNGs can provide a higher level of randomness assurance, which is particularly important for applications like cryptography where the unpredictability of the random numbers is critical. [5]\n",
    "\n",
    "For the problem of searching for number kk in the list, Grover's algorithm offers a significant improvement. Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for unstructured search problems that provides a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms. Specifically, Grover's algorithm requires a number of operations proportional to the square root of the number of items in the list, whereas classical algorithms require a number of operations proportional to the total number of items. This means that Grover's algorithm can perform the search with far fewer operations, making it much more efficient for large datasets. Grover's algorithm, along with its extensions and underlying methodology, is broadly applicable and offers a quadratic advantage for many computational tasks that may not initially appear to be unstructured search problems. This makes quantum computing a powerful tool for improving the efficiency of search algorithms. [6]\n",
